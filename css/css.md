# Styling components

Toolbox is **Sass based**, it means you will write enhanced CSS using :
- Nesting
- Variables
- Mixins
- Functions

Check the official [documentation](https://sass-lang.com/) to know more about Sass. Keep in mind that even you can nest 28 levels deep your styles, keep thing clean is always the best approach.

## Linting

So **to ensure a global consistency**, even when working in a large team, **[Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint)** is installed by default. The `stylelint-config-standard` is applied, but **you can change the rules in the `package.json`** of your project. Be sure to have your editor properly configured to see the warnings live during development.
