## Installation

### Installing Toolbox

Before you can run the generator, you need to make sure you have the latest version of [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) installed and **Node v8** installed.

```sh
npm install -g yo
```

Toolbox is a series of different modules. You'll need to install just one though:

```sh
npm install -g generator-toolbox
```

## Initialization

Once the generator is installed, you can then scaffold your styleguide in a few seconds:

```sh
cd path/to/your/project
yo toolbox
```

Follow the prompts and you're ready!
