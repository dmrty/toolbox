# Writing components

Toolbox component hierarchy is based on **[Atomic Design Principles](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)**. It really means that User Interface is made with various sized components.

Those are the **level available** to order your components library :
- **Atoms** : smaller size, will be your UI units
- **Molecules** : groups of atoms bonded together
- **Organisms** : groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex portion of interface
- **Page** : templates made of multiple molecules and organisms to form an interface's page

Normally, you will not need more levels to create a well-organized library.

### Next step

Now, you can learn how to [write components using Twig](twig.html).
