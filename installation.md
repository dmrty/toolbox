# Installation

### Installing Toolbox

Before you can run the generator, you need to make sure you have the latest version of **[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)**, **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)** (optional, but recommanded) and **[Node 8+](https://nodejs.org/en/)** installed.

```shell
$ npm install -g yo yarn
```

Toolbox is a series of different modules, but only [`generator-toolbox`](https://github.com/frontend/generator-toolbox) is required globally.

```shell
$ npm install -g generator-toolbox
```

### Next step

That's it, now you can [start your first project](generator/new-project.html) !
